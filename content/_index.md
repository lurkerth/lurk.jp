Hey! I'm **lurk**, and welcome to my little Internet corner!<br><br>
I like breaking down systems and networks to rebuild them faster, cleaner, and smarter.<br><br>
MikroTiks are my playground — I’m always tweaking, tuning, and pushing them to the limit.<br><br>
I care about privacy and love mixing **_{{< blanklink  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="open source" >}}_**, the Linux kernel, and the Apple ecosystem.<br><br>
At the end of the day, I keep things simple: clean, functional, and efficient.

## \*nix stack I enjoy

- **RHEL** (rock solid)
- **Debian** (minimal and classic)
- **FreeBSD** (clean and powerful)
- **openSUSE** (underrated gem)
